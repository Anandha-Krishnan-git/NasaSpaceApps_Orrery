# 🌌 Orrery Web App: Exploring Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)

An interactive 3D web app visualizing celestial bodies like planets, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), with real-time data integration from space agencies.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

The **Orrery Web App** allows users to explore our solar system and the objects that populate it through a beautiful, interactive 3D model. Using real-time data from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), the app highlights the positions and orbits of planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies, with a special focus on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).

### 🚀 Features:
- 🌟 **3D Solar System Visualization** using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) or [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/)
- 🛰️ **Real-time data** on NEOs fetched from NASA's APIs and ESA's databases.
- 🔍 **Interactive Exploration** with zoom, rotate, and object selection features.
- 🌑 **Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs)**, **Near-Earth Comets (NECs)**, and **Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)** represented dynamically.
- 🕑 **Time Manipulation Controls** to explore the past, present, and future orbits of NEOs.
